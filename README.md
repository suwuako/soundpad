# soundpad
An asynchronous software solution to a digital soundboard for both music and other utilities

## Setup
1. run setup.bat to install prerequisite libraries (setup.sh for unix systems)
2. run main.py to start

## Exceptions
due to library limitations only .wav files can be used

## File Structure
/data/ holds keymaps in json format

/src/ holds library files 

/sounds/ is the reccomended place to store audio files in .wav format

/data/in_use/ is a storage folder to handle asynchronous audio playing
